# `PhyloCompare`

This is a tool to compare phylogenetic trees in different directories, to trees contained in a reference directory. 
The trees are matched according to filename.  
This tool was made with the goal of benchmarking several different tree reconstruction methods to a set of "real" simulated trees. 

## Functions
This tool can output several different pieces of information:
- Topological distance metrics such as Robinson-Foulds or Khuner-Felsenstein distances
- Comparison of extracted pairwise distances
- Branches in common or exclusive to each tree and their lengths
